                <h3>The Transatlantic Slave Trade (TAST)</h3>
                <p>
                    Today, CTSC is taking the time to do the needful, by joining the international community to remember
                    the Transatlantic Slave Trade honoured on March 25, yearly.
                    Today, we remember the inhumane sufferings and survival of millions of our African ancestors who
                    were taken against their will to face many untold horrors. Take 20
                    minutes to watch the YouTube Documentary filmed by the CTSC crew about the Transatlantic Slave
                    Trade. We stand with our brothers and sisters in the diaspora to
                    remember the Transatlantic Slave Trade observed for the first time in 2008. The day honours more
                    than 15 million people who were brutalized for over 400 years as a
                    result of a slave system. Between 1501 and 1830, a ratio of four to one African to European crossed
                    the Atlantic, making the American population more of an extension
                    of Africans than Europeans.
